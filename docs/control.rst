Manage a list of regexes for each chat message to be filtered through, and the user timed out if a match is found. For supported syntax, visit: https://docs.rs/regex/1.2.1/regex/#syntax

This audio player will play through the current song request queue.

Manage your social integrations. If you just subscribed to patreon and still don't see the custom username option on the main dashboard, try refreshing your patreon integration here.
