.. rubric:: Description

This is a program that runs locally on the streamer's computer, and simulates keystrokes when certain events are triggered. You can do some fun things with this like trigger an obs scene or when a certain amount of bits come in, have your in-game character emote or throw a grenade. Right now bits are the only event trigger, but if you have any other ideas just let me know.

.. rubric:: Installation

The secret can be obtained from your dashboard.
